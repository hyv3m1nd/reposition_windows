# reposition_windows
Resizes and repositions multiple Windows programs neatly on a monitor.

This is a utility project developed for personal use.

## Note
Small segments of code may have been copied from GitHub. I do not claim authorship of the entire code, though I did write most of it and put them together.  

## Pending Issues  
(1) At times, the code would throw a permission denied error.  
(2) I have not figured out how to specify the monitor.  
(3) The positioning is still flawed at times.  
(4) A mathematical way to automatically determine the best layout would be very helpful.
