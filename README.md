# reposition_windows
Resizes and repositions multiple Windows programs neatly on a monitor.

This is a utility project developed for personal use.

## Pending Issues
(1) At times, the code would throw a permission denied error.
(2) I have not figured out how to specify the monitor.
(3) The positioning is still flawed at times.
(4) A mathematical way to automatically determine the best layout would be very helpful.
